Description: Compute various node significance measures on networks. This
    package extends the functionality of the igraph package. We provide a
    wrapper around igraph's "evcent" function for computing eigencentrality; an
    alternate implementation of betweenness which utilizes Madduri and Bader's
    SNAP library; and implementations of Burt's constraint and effective
    network size metrics, Borgatti's Key Players algorithm, and Valente's
    bridging metric. The betweenness and Key Players implementation are
    parallelized with OpenMP, which may run faster on systems which have OpenMP
    configured. Optionally, the package can be compiled with MPI, if available
    on your system: The bridging implementation can make use of MPI to spread
    the computation across multiple CPUs.
