Description: This package provides functionality to compute various node centrality measures on networks.
    Included here are functions to compute betweenness centrality (by utilizing Madduri and Bader's
    SNAP library), implementations of Burt's constraint and effective
    network size (ENS) metrics, Borgatti's algorithm to identify key players, and Valente's
    bridging metric. The betweenness and Key Players implementation are
    parallelized with OpenMP, which may run faster on systems which have OpenMP
    configured. Optionally, the package can be compiled with MPI, if available
    on your system. The bridging implementation can make use of MPI to spread
    the computation across multiple CPUs.
