Package development
==================

The package is being developed in the folder "influenceR", which is also the development name of the package. We can rename down the line.

Build instructions:
R CMB build influenceR
R CMD INSTALL influenceR_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz

Todo list
=========

- improve performance of constraint. DONE (wrote sparse mutliplication in C,
  16 hours --> 5 hours)
- write C wrappers for SNAP betweenness calculation
- write C wrapper for Key Players
- write C wrapper for bridging

Open questions
=============

- Name of package?
- Which betweenness code to prefer, igraph or snap?
- Function naming convention?
- Rewrite bridging and Key Players so they use igraph datastructures?
- (how) can we include MPI support?
